This folder contains mostly original code from Mutable Instruments [Elements](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/elements).

Changes applied to the origin to accomodate inclusion in the Kawa Synth project:
* Added CS43L22 DAC driver
* Removed UI (pots, buttons) initialization
* Build code as a static library
* Added API to control the synth from outside
